            Zeitplans.com was designed and created by artisans who realized the need to manage resources at membership based cooperatives and guilds. We understood the challenges from both the artists stand point as well as the management team trying to keep things running smoothly. Being able to reserve a kiln or spray booth so you have enough inventory for an upcoming show or sale. Management being able to account for the ussage of the resources and receive accurate payment so that they can continue to operate. As we realized number of organizations where still using pen and paper or a spreadsheet located on a drive somewhere. Providing an easy to use system that is available 24/7 from anywhere was seen as a huge benefit.
